## Stockwatch project

POC app that lets a user analyse individual stock data;
draw a chart
store the data
and retrieve it again

We are using React and Typescript for the front end on create-react-app boilerplate

Hapi/Express and Mongo DB for the backend

Testing Jest for React
Mocha and Chai for the backend

TDD as much as possible

### To Dos:

1. Boilerplate for the app
2. test IEX Data API connection/display
     basic info
3. graphing the data and formatting frontend Chart.js D3
4. storing the data in the MongoDB
5. how do we process the data based on the data provided by the API for example momentum or period returns performance against an index

### branching strategy:

create individual branches and work on them freely rebase between individual branches as needed but only merge into master when everyone agrees
